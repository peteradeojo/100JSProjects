						<p class="mt-1">
							100JSProjects is my personal self-development project in which I attempt to complete 100 JavaScript
							projects every day for the next 100 days. The date this repository was created is 1/28/2021.
							<br/><br/>
							There are no frameworks, no External CSS CDN (like BootStrap) or External JavaScript (Jquery) used in the development
							of this website. Everything was coded purely by me.
							<br/><br/>
							This, I believe, will help me, a beginner, to better my self and obviously gain new skills.
							<br/><br/>
							If you're a beginner, I also advise that you use your skills to complete one project or the other, or accomplish a certain task
							as often as possible. This is great practice.
