# 100JSProjects

100JSProjects is my personal self-development project in which I attempt to complete 100 JavaScript projects every day for the next 100 days. The date this repository was created is 1/28/2021.
<br/><br/>
There are no frameworks, no External CSS CDN (like BootStrap) or External JavaScript (Jquery) used in the development of this website. Everything was coded purely by me.
<br/><br/>
This, I believe, will help me, a beginner, to better my self and obviously gain new skills.
<br/><br/>

> If you're a beginner, I also advise that you use your skills to complete one project or the other, or accomplish a certain task as often as possible. This is great practice.
